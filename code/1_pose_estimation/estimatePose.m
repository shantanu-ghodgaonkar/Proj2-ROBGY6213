function [position, orientation] = estimatePose(data, t)
%% CHANGE THE NAME OF THE FUNCTION TO estimatePose
% Please note that the coordinates for each corner of each AprilTag are
% defined in the world frame, as per the information provided in the
% handout. Ideally a call to the function getCorner with ids of all the
% detected AprilTags should be made. This function should return the X and
% Y coordinate of each corner, or each corner and the centre, of all the
% detected AprilTags in the image. You can implement that anyway you want
% as long as the correct output is received. A call to that function
% should made from this function.
    %% Input Parameter Defination
    % data = the entire data loaded in the current dataset
    % t = index of the current data in the dataset
    
    %% Output Parameter Defination
    
    % position = translation vector representing the position of the
    % drone(body) in the world frame in the current time, in the order ZYX
    
    % orientation = euler angles representing the orientation of the
    % drone(body) in the world frame in the current time, in the order ZYX
